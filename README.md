# **[Project 1: Gained and Lost Costumers ](https://github.com/ichiisti/gl)**

*Objective:*

This project has the objective to monitor customer dynamics for B2C and B2B clients, by calculating yearly gains and losses, tracking churn rate, evaluating net changes in customer base, and monitoring key competitors in both B2C and B2B markets.


# **[Project 2: Realised Gross Margin Calculation ](https://github.com/ichiisti/rgm_v1)**

*Objective:*

This project has the object to optimize financial analysis , by implementing a cost allocation algorithm and calculating gross margins on a per-customer basis for realized period. 

# **[Project 3: Estimated Gross Margin Calculation ](https://github.com/ichiisti/pgm)**

*Objective:*

This project has 2 main objective:

1. Implement algorithm for cost allocation using allocation keys and simulating the gross margins on a per-customer basis for the middle term (3 year).
2. Create data sets for in deep analysis in BI tool ( gained, lost and existing costumers, Contracted quantites for short and middle term).

# **[Project 4: EtL process for flat files ](https://github.com/ichiisti/EtL_process)**

*Objective:*

Create a general EtL process that can be used for retrieve all the required data from source files and load into database. The Etl process has a "lite" transformation stage.

# **[Project 5: Consumption analysis ](https://github.com/ichiisti/consump_analysis)**

*Objective:*

This project has the objective to analyse the hourly consumption curve to determine efficiently and inefficiently traded quantities.
